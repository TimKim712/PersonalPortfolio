        Thanks for visiting! My name is Timothy Kim, and I'm currently pursuing a bachelor's of science in software engineering
        at San Jos√© State University. My main interests lie in full-stack development and low-level systems programming, but I'm always exploring
        other areas where my skills can be best applied.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of now, I am interning at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where I am working on a data archival tool utilized by a variety of other teams within the Lab.
        I'm also the treasurer of our school's ACM chapter and compete in the university's archery team. Outside of school, you can catch me running,
        playing/watching basketball, at the archery range, or having a great time with family and friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I am looking for any new grad roles related to software engineering and/or development, embedded systems, and firmware.
        If anything here sparks your interest, please don't hesitate in contacting me! 
      </p>
